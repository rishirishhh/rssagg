# RSS feed aggregator 
Building a RSS feed aggregator in Go!!! It's a web server that allows clients to:
1. Add RSS feeds to be collected
2. Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
3. Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!
